# Description
This plugin allow you to choose a starting and ending date for the registration of your users by using the profilefields.
At the installation the plugin will create a new profilefield category called "Registration duration to the site" with the fields "Start" and "End" inside.
The category will be placed in the first position of categories.
The new category can be renamed or remove if you want and the fields too (If you remove the two fields the plugin become useless of course but you can remove one of them if needed).
You can personnalise the two fields like you want but don't modify the shortname, without this the field can't be recognized by the plugin and become useless.

# Functioning
